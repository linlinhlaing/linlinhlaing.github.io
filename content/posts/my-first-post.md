## Introduction

Python is dynamically typed, meaning both values and their types are stored in memory. Each time an operation is performed, including during a for-loop, Python checks the type of each element, which slows down execution. This frequent type checking and storage of type information make pure Python inefficient for handling large datasets compared to statically typed languages or optimized libraries.
